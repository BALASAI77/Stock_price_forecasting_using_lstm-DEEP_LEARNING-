# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

## Overview
This project aims to predict future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. It utilizes historical stock price data, preprocesses it, builds an LSTM model, trains the model on the data, evaluates its performance, and predicts future stock prices.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- matplotlib
